Step 2: Using spyder IDE 
-	Open all the three python files present in folder.
-	Run and Execute the Main.py in Spyder IDE to train and evaluate the 3link robot arm.
-	Once the training is complete, a trained 3-link robot environment window will pop up. 
- Use any of the two evaluation option to create new goal points in the 2D plane and test the trained robotic arm if it reaches the new goal or not.

Evaluation 1: Human input- Use mouse to input new goal coordinates.
Evaluation 2: Random Input- click on 'close window button' to generate new random goal       coordinates. 

Step 3: View results on your local machine.
